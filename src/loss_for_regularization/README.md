# This directory contains the loss functions class that involves regularizing weights of the network being optimized. L2 weight regularization is already covered by the typical torch.optim class. Any another class will be covered here.

# usage:
- when initializing the class, wrap the main loss function inside the class, to produce an overall loss function.
