# full-rank deep map followed by projection
This repo contains experiments that it might be possible to separate the idea of a deep network from the rank reduction properties.

## idea: Use full rank map followed by full rank projection.
Typical deep DC network uses a successive layers, with reducing number of neurons. This result in successively reducing the rank of, until at least, the rank is at most one.
